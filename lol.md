Here’s a **full hackathon-ready README** with the ports explicitly mentioned for both backend and UI, along with all setup instructions:


## Project Overview
Briefly describe what your project does.  
Example:  
This project is a healthcare dashboard that allows users to input patient data, generate personalized health assessments, and visualize the results dynamically.

````

---

## 1. Prerequisites
- **Python 3.10+** (for backend)  
- **Node.js + npm** (for frontend)  
- Git  

---

## 2. Set Up the Backend
```bash
cd backend
uv sync      # Install dependencies
uv run main.py
````

This will install dependencies and start the backend server at **[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)**.
You can access API docs at **[http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)**.

---

## 3. Set Up the UI

```bash
cd ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the UI development server at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** and connect to the backend automatically.

---

## 4. Environment Variables (Optional)

If your project uses API keys or secrets, create `.env` files in the respective folders:

**Backend (`backend/.env`):**

```
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DATABASE_URL=your_db_url_here
```

**UI (`ui/.env`):**

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

---

## 5. Running Both Together

1. Start the backend:

```bash
cd backend
uv run main.py
```

2. Start the frontend in a separate terminal:

```bash
cd ui
npm run dev
```

3. Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your browser.

---

## 6. Screenshots

(Add screenshots or GIFs of your app here for demo purposes)

---

## 7. License

Include your license (if any) or remove this section.

---

## Notes

* Make sure ports **3000** (frontend) and **8000** (backend) are free.
* Use `npm run build` to generate a production build for the frontend.
* For hackathon submission, ensure both `ui` and `backend` folders are included.

```

If you want, I can also **add a one-command “start everything” script** so judges can just run the project without opening two terminals. It’s super handy for hackathons.  

Do you want me to do that?
